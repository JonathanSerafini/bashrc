# bashrc

Bashrc is a quick script to setup and configure my bash environment. Most of the work for this went into making a few helper methods to auto-detect the presence of Mac OSX or Linux as well as to support have local ~/.config/bashrc overrides.

# Usage

Because what could go wrong ? ;) 

`source bin/bashrc`
